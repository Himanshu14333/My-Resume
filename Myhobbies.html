    <p>A hobby is an activity that someone enjoys doing in their spare time.<br> It can be anything from cooking and gardening to playing sports and collecting stamps.br There are no rules about what makes a good hobby, so it is entirely up to the individual to choose something that they enjoy.<br> Some people like to spend their free time doing something active, while others prefer to relax and take part in a more passive activity.Music, dance, reading, story writing, sports, philately, painting and theatre may all be hobbies.<br> Interestingly, one persons profession may be another persons hobby. For instance, one could be a professional flautist, but for another playing the flute could be a hobby.</p>
